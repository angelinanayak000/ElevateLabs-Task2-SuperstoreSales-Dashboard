## Tools Used

* **Tableau** (for data visualization and dashboard creation)
* **Superstore Sales Data:**  <a href="">Superstore Sales Data</a>

## Dashboard Overview

This dashboard effectively analyzes Sales, Profit, and Quantity performance from the Superstore dataset. It precisely utilizes the following visual components to present key business insights:

* A **map chart** displaying **Profit by State**.
* A **bar chart** showing **Profit by Category**.
* A **table** detailing **Sales, Profit, and Quantity by Category**.

While not separate "card" visuals, the dashboard prominently displays the **overall aggregated totals** for Profit, Sales, and Quantity.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Data from the Dashboard

Below are the exact figures extracted from the dashboard visuals, forming the basis of the insights.

1.  **Overall Aggregated Totals:**
    * Total Profit: **$286.40K**
    * Total Sales: **$2.30M**
    * Total Quantity: **37.98K**

2.  **"Profit by Category" Bar Chart (Numbers on the bars):**
    * Technology Profit: **$146.54K**
    * Office Supplies Profit: **$126.02K**
    * Furniture Profit: **$19.73K**

3.  **"Sales, Profit, Quantity by Category" Table (Bottom Visual):**

## Insights Derived from the Dashboard

Based on the precise figures presented in the dashboard, here are the key business insights:

1.  **Technology is the Leader in Both Sales and Profit:**

2.  **Furniture: High Sales, Disproportionately Low Profit:**
    * The **Furniture** category records substantial sales at **$754.74K**, but its profit is remarkably low at just **$19.73K**. This is a critical insight: despite its strong sales volume, Furniture yields almost negligible profit, signaling potential issues with cost structures, aggressive discounting, or product profitability within this segment. This area demands immediate investigation.

3.  **Office Supplies: Consistent High Volume, Solid Profitability:**
    * **Office Supplies** shows **$731.89K in sales** and contributes a strong profit of **$126.02K**. Notably, it has the highest quantity sold at **23,268 units**. This category demonstrates consistent performance with good profitability across a high volume of transactions, acting as a reliable profit contributor.

4.  **Significant Geographical Profit Disparities:**
    * States like **California ($76.38K)** and **New York ($74.04K)** are identified as major profit centers, contributing significantly to the overall profitability.
    * Conversely, several states are incurring substantial losses. **Texas (-$25.76K)** leads this group, followed by **Ohio (-$16.94K), Pennsylvania (-$15.56K), and Illinois (-$12.20K)**, among others. These are critical regions where the business is losing money, necessitating targeted investigation into local market conditions, operational costs, or sales strategies.
